# Responsive-Portfolio

This project was done using bootstrap to create a responsive website. The website includes my personal information and portfolio. The website includes a nav bar, images, and a responsive layout to demonstrate the ability to use bootstrap to personalize a website. One of the biggest challenges of creating a website is to make it responsive to different screen sizes. This was probably the biggest challenge I had in creating this website and I used the bootstrap documentation vigorously to work on accomplishing that goal.

The main features of this project are 3 html pages. These are the index page, portfolio page, and contact page. The pages were specifically designed with my own projects and include a footer with my personal social media links.
